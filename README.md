In their paper, A hypothesis is a liability, Yanai and Lercher argue that hypotheses come with a hidden cost. Our minds focus on the specific hypothesis we want to disprove, preventing us from finding new ideas in data. In the paper, some subjects of their experiment were also given a specific hypothesis to test while others were asked to simply explore the data. 

However, there was an important glaring pattern in the data that a scatterplot revealed the picture of a gorilla. They found that people with a specific hypothesis to test were more likely to miss this pattern in the data. This idea is similar to another in the philosophy of science. Norwood Russell Hanson argued that astronomers Kepler and Brahe, opposing in theory, literally saw different things at dawn. After performing my own data analysis project, I agree with the conclusions of Yanai and Lercher. There dozens of tables and graphs that did not make into this final document simply because they were focused a specific question that yielded underwhelming results. I would also argue that modern post-hoc analyses add to the statistical power of our tests. Post-hoc analyses allow us to aggregate massive sample sizes that are more likely to be normal distributed regardless of the populationâ€™s distribution. The following is my exploration and post-hoc analysis of a data set published by The California Department of Public Health from 22 years of disease records.
